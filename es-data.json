[18] [22] Chest pain (10%), cough (7%), and sore throat (9%) have also been reported, [19] but direct involvement of the lungs has only rarely been reported. [81] Myalgia has also been reported (22%) and, in facilities that could measure this, raised creatine kinase was common (36% to 83%). [19] [79] [82] [83] Three phases of illness are typically recognised, starting with a few days of non-specific fever, headache, and myalgia, and followed by a gastrointestinal phase where diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal symptoms, and dehydration are prominent. [58] In the second week, the patient may either recover, or deteriorate with a third phase of illness, which includes collapse, neurological manifestations, and bleeding. This phase is often fatal. [18] Data from the 2014 outbreak indicate that children are relatively spared; however, this may be confounded by a high fatality rate before being registered as a case, or the bias of high rates in healthcare workers. [84] Children present with similar symptoms to adults; however, in previous outbreaks, younger children are reported to have more respiratory (e.g., cough, dyspnoea) and gastrointestinal symptoms, but less bleeding and neurological signs compared with adults. [85] Data were sparse for this patient group in the 2014 outbreak. [85] [86] A paediatric cohort study in Sierra Leone described symptoms in 282 patients and found vomiting (60%), abdominal pain (59%), diarrhoea (45%), and conjunctivitis (38%) were common, while hiccups (5%) and bleeding (2%) were rare. [87] Another study in Sierra Leone found that weakness, fever, and distress were each present in more than 63% of children, and loss of appetite, diarrhea, and cough were present in more than 50%. Approximately 25% of these children did not have fever at the time of admission. [88] Anecdotally, children under 4 years of age initially present with more subtle symptoms before developing a fever, and are often diagnosed later in the course of illness."}
